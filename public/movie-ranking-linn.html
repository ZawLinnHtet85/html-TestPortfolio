<h1>The Best TV Series according to Linn</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 TV Series that I watched in 2024</h2>

<h3>Mare of Easttown</h3>

<p>
One of the best series I have seen in awhile. A brilliant 7 part series. Kate Winslet was brilliant of course, her character was miserable but so likeable! Storyline was full of cliffhangers and there are a couple of fantastic twists!
</p>

<h3>The Day of the Jackal</h3>

<p>
This was the best cat and mouse, contract killer vs MI6 show I have ever seen. A mix of mission impossible and 007 with the best cast, direction, production and writing that really makes this tv series stand out and most likely the best of the year!
</p>

<h3>The Madness</h3>

<p>
Wrong place at the wrong time - some get out of this easily, some don’t and some just can’t - this series is the last case where the system just locks in and suffocates one person.
